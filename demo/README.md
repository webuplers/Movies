## Developer Test

### Overview

The Developer Test is a simple test we give our prospective web developers to see how they do given a coding task.

The premise is simple, create a simple website that will be able to perform a search using the Search API for movies containing any of the following words: red, green, blue or yellow.

The output should be a web page that displays matching movies with their details (title, year, runtime and image) on a page. Also, extract the first matching word in the movie title from the list of colours and show it somewhere on the movie details (maybe as the background colour).

Things we are looking for:
- use of a backend framework / CMS (eg, Wordpress, Laravel)
- use of a frontend framework (eg, JQuery, Bootstrap)
- use of a front end pre-processor (eg, Gulp, Yarn)
- use of git (please provide your git log)
- use of a database

Optional functionality you may like to include
 - Caching of search results
 - Good use of DOM counts
 - Mobile Responsiveness
 - Lighthouse performance export

Notes:
* Your HTML and CSS should pass W3 validation
